# SIFT Correspondence: Scene Alignment using Key-point Matching
Fall 2016 DSP Project

This is the source code and dataset for SIFT Correspondence. 

## Abstract of our report:

While image alignment has been studied in different areas for decades, aligning images depicting different scenes remains a challenging problem. In this project, we propose SIFT correspondence, a method to align an image to its nearest neighbors in reference image group containing a variety of scenes. The SIFT correspondence consists of matching pixel-wise SIFT features between two images. Experiments for evaluating the algorithm is implemented on a image dataset containing 10 buildings on Columbia University campus. Experimental results show that robust building recognition can be achieved in cell- phone photographed images with a computational time of about 1.2 seconds and accuracy over 90%.
